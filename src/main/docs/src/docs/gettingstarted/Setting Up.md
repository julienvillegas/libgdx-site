<h1>Setting up Environment</h1>

This article provides you with the information required before you start importing a LibGDX project.

LibGDX projects are built and managed with the Gradle build tool.
This allows you to develop in almost any environment that takes your fancy, even if
you are working in a team.

The 3 major java IDEs, IDEA/Android Studio, Eclipse and Netbeans are all supported, just make sure you have
set them up correctly.

<div class="well info">
    <strong>
    It is highly recommended that you use the Intellij IDE.
    </strong>
